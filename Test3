Enhancing Security and Monitoring Across Databases and Applications
1. Enable Database Activity Monitoring (DAM)
To align with security guidelines, we will implement Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) across all databases. This initiative will help ensure compliance, detect anomalies, and safeguard sensitive data.
2. Activate Log Aggregation for Istio Envoy Proxy
We will enable log aggregation for the Istio Envoy proxy and other critical applications. This step is essential for establishing a centralized logging system, facilitating better visibility, and improving troubleshooting capabilities across our infrastructure.
3. Develop Comprehensive Dashboards
We will create dashboards that encompass all relevant metrics to monitor changes effectively. These dashboards will provide real-time insights into system performance and health, enabling proactive management of resources.
4. Establish a Robust Alerting System
A critical alerting system will be established for all projects, ensuring timely notifications for any issues that arise. Additionally, we will conduct regular reviews of recurring alerts to refine our response strategies and minimize noise. By implementing these measures, we will significantly enhance our security posture and monitoring capabilities, leading to improved operational efficiency and risk management
