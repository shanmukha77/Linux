I would like to bring to your attention the progress we have made in addressing all outstanding issues at both the container and host levels, as detailed in the email thread below.
As you know, the UPI switch revamp exercise is currently underway at the organizational level and is a top priority project. In light of this, we kindly seek your assistance in obtaining sign-off for the UAT cluster.
I fully align with our organization's policies regarding application ID requirements for sign-off. However, acquiring the application ID typically involves a significant amount of time. Therefore, we respectfully request your exceptional approval to expedite this process and provide the necessary sign-off.
Rest assured, as soon as we receive the application ID, we will promptly share it with you.
Thank you for considering our request. Your support is greatly appreciated
