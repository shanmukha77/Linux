To enhance infrastructure automation across projects like 811, Onb Crossell, and Cloud Aqui, we will establish a robust automation platform focused on security audits. This initiative includes transitioning egress flows from NAT gateways to firewalls, ensuring compliance with information security and IRM findings. By implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, we can streamline processes, mitigate risks, and enhance security across all operations. This strategic approach will drive efficiency and agility within our IT infrastructure.
