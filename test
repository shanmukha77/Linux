: During the project kickoff meeting, I actively participated in gathering requirements from developers to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the project needs. I designed and implemented the architecture for all microservices, taking into account the criticality of the application.
I ensured that the microservices were deployed in accordance with the 811 policies, maintaining compliance and best practices. Additionally, I was involved in technical discussions regarding application security, specifically focusing on Checkmarx SAST and DAST. My contributions helped guide the development team toward achieving their goals effectively
